# 🏡 Brief Summary of My Homelab

## 🏠 Project Overview

This project presents a self-designed homelab resembling a corporate environment, where I practice virtualization, network security, and system administration on both Linux and Windows systems. It includes solutions for both Windows and Linux.  

To implement this project and learn the underlying theory, I relied heavily on Udemy courses, YouTube videos, articles, and forums—all in English. I also started using ChatGPT, which I found useful for drastically speeding up information gathering and searching.  

❗❗❗I have prepared detailed documentation for myself about installation processes, configuration files, what and how I set up, problems that occurred, and their solutions, illustrated with images—but these are not published here.

> 🎯 **Goal**:  
Alongside theoretical knowledge, I aim to gain practical experience and explore new technologies. When selecting technologies, I considered current job market trends, occasionally influenced by my available budget.  
Additionally, it is important that potential employers can easily assess my skills during job applications and determine whether I am the right candidate.

## 🔮 Further Learning and Implementation Goals

- **Deepen knowledge of Python programming.**  
- **Cloud computing.** I am interested in this field and want to learn more (AWS, Azure).  
- **Advanced monitoring.** Learn Grafana + Prometheus; deepen Zabbix knowledge.  
- **Cloud storage** (Hetzner or pCloud).  
- **High availability.** Plan to acquire three 2.5" SSDs and a Lenovo M920q Tiny PC, on which I will install Proxmox and form a three-node **cluster** with my existing machines. My goal is to integrate the three SSDs into **Ceph**.  
- **DIY PiKVM.** KVM over IP would be useful. I plan to buy an RPI 4 to implement PiKVM.  
- **IDS/IPS improvement.** Deepen CrowdSec knowledge, configure it on Nginx Proxy Manager, and implement Suricata.  
- **Upgrade to a more advanced switch.** I want to experiment with 802.1x port-based authentication and set up RADIUS monitoring on the ports. Using DHCP snooping and port security, I can further improve security.
