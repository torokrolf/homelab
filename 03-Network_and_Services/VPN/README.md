# VPN Usage for the Homelab

- I use **OpenVPN** and **WireGuard** VPN servers, and I have also tested **Tailscale**.  
- This allows me to easily access my homelab and the services running on it from my phone.  
- By configuring **full tunnel** mode, the phone uses the **Pi-hole DNS** for ad blocking.
