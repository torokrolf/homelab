## TrueNAS

In the homelab, I run **TrueNAS as a VM** to easily manage storage and shares.

### TrueNAS – Why TrueNAS:

- Easy creation and management of SMB/CIFS shares  
- Simple user and permission (policy) management  
- Many built-in features: **ZFS, snapshots, replication, data protection**  
- Stable and clear management for network shares
