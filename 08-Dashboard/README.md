## Homarr Dashboard

- Navigating between many services became inconvenient over time, so I organized them on a **central dashboard**.
- For this purpose, I use **Homarr**, which allows me to access all services **from a single interface**, quickly and easily.
- An additional advantage is that it is **very mobile-friendly**, so the entire homelab can be easily managed from a phone.
