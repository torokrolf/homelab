## My Backup Strategy

- Full Proxmox host image with Clonezilla (**block-level backup**)  
- VM and LXC backups to Proxmox Backup Server (**block-level incremental backup**)  
- Windows laptop system backup with Veeam Backup & Replication Community Edition to SMB share (**block-level incremental backup**)  
- Windows and Ubuntu dual-boot machine backup with Macrium Reflect  
- Nextcloud file sharing between laptop and phone  
- Phone photos backed up to SMB share via FolderSync (**one-way sync**)  
- Laptop file sync with FreeFileSync, later replaced by Restic for versioned backup (**file-level backup**)

## Veeam or Macrium for Dual-Boot Machines?

I use Veeam B&R to back up Linux or Windows with its agent. However, for dual-boot systems:

- Windows agent and Linux agent cannot run simultaneously  
- The agent only sees and backs up the currently running OS  
- Without the agent, a full disk backup is possible, but Linux filesystems are often not handled properly  

For dual-boot machines (e.g., an old laptop with Ubuntu + Windows), Macrium should be used.  

Macrium creates a full disk image:

- It doesn’t care which OS is installed  
- Backs up the partition table, bootloader, everything  
- Perfect for dual-boot / multi-boot machines  
- Boot partitions are also backed up

### 1.4.1 Advantages of Nextcloud

- Self-hosted file and photo management  
- No need for Google Drive / other cloud services; Nextcloud is my own personal cloud  
- Full control and security

### 1.4.2 Issues
### Issues – Trusted Domains / Whitelist

Nextcloud only allows access from addresses listed in the `config.php` file under the `trusted_domains` list.

- If an address is not whitelisted, it may work via IP but not DNS (or vice versa), and Nextcloud will give an untrusted domain error  
- If accessed through an **NGINX reverse proxy** (e.g., `nextcloud.trkrolf.com`), the **DNS name must be added** to the whitelist  
- If using a **local DNS name** (e.g., `nextcloud.home.local`) or an **IP address**, these must also be added separately  
- **When using Tailscale**, the server’s **Tailscale IP** must also be added; otherwise, remote access will not work
